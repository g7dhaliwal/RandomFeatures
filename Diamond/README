The code to fit potential for diamond data is stored under models. Currently, only 4th order polynomial kernels are approximated through this code.
Models has two files
 
  1.) fitRFM.py is the main file to run this code
  2.) inputs.py stores the appropriate input parameters necessary to run the above code.
To perform energy/force fitting, simply run python ftRFM.py

Requirements

Following packages are required

1.) numpy
2.) ase
3.) quippy with GAP support
